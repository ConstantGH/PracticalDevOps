Lab #3 - Release Pipeline QuickStart - Verify deployment to Azure
====================================================================================

## Description
In this lab we will verify the deployment of our Application to Azure

## Confirming successful deployment to Azure

**Step 1.** In Azure, find your App Service and open its url.

Congratulations on successfully setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment with VSTS.


Summary
-------
In this lab, you have learned how to create a Continuous Integration build that runs when new commits are pushed to the master branch and create a Continuous Deployment that deploys an application to environments automatically.
This allows you to receive feedback as to whether your changes contain syntactical errors or break existing tests, as well as saving time by automating the deployment process.
